Title: Harmony.

Today Simphiwe had the chance to play my melody on the church piano.

At first he read the notes and gave me a sly look. "You a smooth one neh? Where did you see octaves Papa Johnny?" he remarked about the way I wrote out the
melody.
"Learned it from you Simphiwe." I told him. He looked shocked that I pay attention to his playing.
"It's lekka!... but it needs some chords... key of C ne?" Simphiwe said as he began playing something on his piano.
"Key of C baba." I replied promptly.

Simphiwe always knows just the right things to play. He plays for the gospel band at out community church with me. It's not a big church, everyone knows each
other,
but when Simphiwe "shappas" the chords (plays them excitingly), everyone lifts their hands and praises the Lord. Once I know which chords he is playing, I can
start thinking about a bassline.

Both Simphiwe and me can play tunes by ear. We sometimes use sheet music but we don't understand all the things about it. We are one of the few people that 
can do it in the neighborhood. I write things in sheet music more
than Simphiwe does. He kinda just knows and can flow with it.

Besides us always playing harmoniously together in the church band, our friendship is like a harmony of its own. Sometimes I hit a
wrong note with him or he hits a wrong note with me, but I have just come to realise that there really are no wrong notes... just the life we spend
together. As long as we continue to appreciate each other, we can move forward and make a success of our music.

Chord progression:
C7 | C7 | C7 | C7 |
F7 | F7 | C7 | C7 |
G7 | F7 | C7 | G7 |
