            <p>
                I woke up this morning with the tune in my head... I can't wait to play it for Simphiwe... but first I need to write it down. 
                It's like God is speaking to me... Is this melody the spark I need to write a famous song?
            </p>
            <p>
                Quickly I jotted the notes down on a piece of paper. Hopefully, I got the notes right. Simphiwe will check them for me when I show him another time.

                Oh no, I'm gonna be late for work!
            </p>
            <p>
                Must rush! Must get dressed... Must wash my face... What am I going to wear?
            </p>
            <p>
                Mama always says I look untidy for work. She expects I must always be clean and brush my hair thoroughly... but some days Mama all I have on my mind is the
                music! Today is one of those days!
            </p>
            <p>
                "Do you think I make Papa proud Mama?" I asked her as I leave the house. "Papa was always proud of you young man!", Mama replied "But you must focus now.
                You have to work harder!" Mama's gaze is stern but also kind. I can tell how much she cares about me. I wish I can be home more with Mama but I have to work
                constantly to bring in enough money. My spare time is taken up by music practice with the boys. I can't let them down either.
            </p>

                "These clothes are too dark for this sun", I thought to myself. But it was too late, I needed to get to work...
