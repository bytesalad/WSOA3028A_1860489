                It All Pays Off!
            </h2>
            <p>
                Today was an important day for me. Let's start with the good news.
            </p>
            <p>
                The more me and my band worked on the song "Spark of Genius", the more musicians in the neighborhood joined in! At first it was just me,
                Simphiwe and Mozza. Mozza's friend Jacob joined in to play the trumpet. A drummer by the slippy sly name of "Stooka" came along to play 
                drums with us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Together we are Mbeki's Swing! and today we got to record the song at the studio. I think the mix came out well and if you want to hear it,
                check the SoundCloud player below.

                Everyone in Sophiatown is singing my melody! I cannot believe that some people are comparing me to the legendary <cite><a href="https://hughmasekela.co.za/">Hugh Masekela</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The future does not look absolutely certain for my band though. There is word of a "relocation" by the South African Government. Knowing how
                badly they treat my people, I am not very optimistic about the future. But my hopes are in my band and in God. I am making Mama proud and
                Papa must be smiling down at me from heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
                Music is my life and I hope people will enjoy "Spark of Genius" for years to come!
            </p>

                Making of Spark of Genius
            </h3>
            <p>
                Spark of Genius was composed, recorded, mixed and mastered by me (Matthew Brown) for the fictional character Johnathan Mbeki. I used <a href="https://www.tracktion.com/products/waveform-free">Waveform 
                    11 Free</a>
                to mix it and <a href="https://medium.com/pragmatic-sound/what-are-virtual-instruments-c762055ddf71">virtual instruments</a>
                 for the percussion, piano, bass, saxophone and trumpet parts. I played all the parts on my MIDI keyboard at home during the <a href="https://www.gov.za/coronavirus/guidelines">lockdown</a>. 
                 I hope you enjoy it as much as I did while producing it!
