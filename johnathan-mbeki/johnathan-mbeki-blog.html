            <h2>
                Harmony
            </h2>
            <p>
                Today Simphiwe had the chance to play my melody on the church piano.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first he read the notes and gave me a sly look. "You a smooth one neh? Where did you see octaves Papa Johnny?" he remarked about the way I wrote out the
                melody.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Learned it from you Simphiwe." I told him. He seemed shocked that I pay attention to his playing.

            <h2>
                Spark of Genius (Narrated by Johnathan Mbeki)
            </h2>
            <p>
                I woke up this morning with the tune in my head. I can't wait to play it for Simphiwe. but first I need to write it down. 
                It's like God is speaking to me. Is this melody the spark I need to write a famous song?

            <h2>
                Johnathan Mbeki About
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Johnathan Mbeki was a Jazz bassist/composer living in Sophiatown, Johannesburg,
                South Africa during the 1950s. He was the bandleader and lead composer for
                Mbeki's Swing; an Afro-Jazz and Gospel band.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was the only child of Annie and Simon Mbeki. For most of his childhood, he
                lived in a single-parent home with his mother Annie. Due, unfortunately
                to lung cancer, his father passed away when Johnathan was only 5 years old.
                Johnathan was commonly referred to by his peers and members of the community
                as "Papa Johnny" because of his mature and wise outlook on life especially
                in his younger days.
