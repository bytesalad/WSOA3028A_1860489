                This blog post is based on the web article "An eye-opening look at the dot-com 
                bubble of 2000 â€” and how it shapes our lives today" written by Brian
                McCullough at Ideas.Ted.com.[1]

                The dot-com bubble refers to a period between the late 1990s and early 2000s
                during which there was a rapid rise and fall of internet commerce websites. It
                had consequences for many years on the global economy.

                There existed a strong belief that if people invested more money into new tech
                companies sprouting out on the internet, they would grow into massive 
                enterprises with favourable returns. It would not be untrue to say that there
                was indeed growth.

                Biography

            <p>
                Johnathan Mbeki was a Jazz bassist/composer living in Sophiatown, Johannesburg,
                South Africa during the 1950s. He was the bandleader and lead composer for
                Mbeki's Swing; an Afro-Jazz and Gospel band.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was the only child of Annie and Simon Mbeki. For most of his childhood, he
                lived in a single-parent home with his mother Annie. Due, unfortunately
                to lung cancer, his father passed away when Johnathan was only 5 years old.
                Johnathan was commonly referred to by his peers and members of the community
                as "Papa Johnny" because of his mature and wise outlook on life especially
                in his younger days.
