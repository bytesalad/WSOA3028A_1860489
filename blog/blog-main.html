            <h2>
                How Effective are the Current Generally Accepted Metaphors for Describing Digital Information Related to the WWW?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Words such as "folder", "path", "link", "location", "home", "document", and "file" have become so popularly compared to computer data structures that
                they can be thought of to the average user as the same. They have provided a level of abstraction for users to better understand how a computer works
                and definitely to better understand how the World Wide Web (WWW) functions. Especially how one can find information and remember where it is. However, are 
                these metaphors effective for all people using the system?

            <h2>
                The Misunderstood Complexity Regarding the Importance of Accessibility on the Web.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Accessibility is a term that is commonly used in web development circles but it can be said that the true 
                extensiveness of its applications and implications are seldomly explored. Accessibility is explored in
                the context of <cite><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Accessibility">disability accessibility</a></cite> and there 
                exists mainly information about accessibility
                regarding this context. It is very important to consider disabled person experiences when using your
                website because if not, one effectively implies a solid barrier of prevention to
                the valuable content on one's website. This is both practical and in some ways ethically a
                negligent implementation of a website. There is more to accessibility than the above consideration
                though. In this blog I will briefly consider each with citations to further reading about the subject.

            <h2>
                Definitions of Hypermedia and How They May Manifest in the Modern Digital Age.
            </h2>
            <p>
                While reading <cite><a href="http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CS835/Lec3/p126-wardrip-fruin.pdf">"What Hypertext Is?"</a></cite>, 
                a research paper by Noah Wardrip-Fruin, I
                decided to try and discover new perspectives of looking at the different
                definitions of hypermedia. Specifically with regard to the digital media age of
                today. I feel that regarding the context of all the new technologies available
                today, many of the seemingly conflicting definitions of hypermedia and hypertext
                are manifesting together to describe a single object, technology or interaction.

                The dot-com bubble refers to a period between the late 1990s and early 2000s
                during which there was a rapid rise and fall of internet commerce websites. It
                had consequences for many years on the global economy. There existed a strong belief that if people 
                invested more money into new tech
                companies sprouting out on the internet, they would grow into massive 
                enterprises with favourable returns. It would not be untrue to say that there
                was indeed growth.

            <h2>
                Biography
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Johnathan Mbeki was a Jazz bassist/composer living in Sophiatown, Johannesburg,
                South Africa during the 1950s. He was the bandleader and lead composer for
                Mbeki's Swing; an Afro-Jazz and Gospel band.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was the only child of Annie and Simon Mbeki. For most of his childhood, he
                lived in a single-parent home with his mother Annie. Due, unfortunately
                to lung cancer, his father passed away when Johnathan was only 5 years old.
                Johnathan was commonly referred to by his peers and members of the community
                as "Papa Johnny" because of his mature and wise outlook on life especially
                in his younger days.
