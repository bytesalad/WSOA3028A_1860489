            <h2>
                Definitions of Hypermedia and How They May Manifest in the Modern Digital Age.
            </h2>
            <p>
                While reading <cite><a href="http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CS835/Lec3/p126-wardrip-fruin.pdf">"What Hypertext Is?"</a></cite>, 
                a research paper by Noah Wardrip-Fruin, I
                decided to try and discover new perspectives of looking at the different
                definitions of hypermedia. Specifically with regard to the digital media age of
                today. I feel that regarding the context of all the new technologies available
                today, many of the seemingly conflicting definitions of hypermedia and hypertext
                are manifesting together to describe a single object, technology or interaction.

                This blog post is based on the web article "An eye-opening look at the dot-com 
                bubble of 2000 â€” and how it shapes our lives today" written by Brian
                McCullough at Ideas.Ted.com.[1]

                The dot-com bubble refers to a period between the late 1990s and early 2000s
                during which there was a rapid rise and fall of internet commerce websites. It
                had consequences for many years on the global economy.

            <h2>
                Biography
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Johnathan Mbeki was a Jazz bassist/composer living in Sophiatown, Johannesburg,
                South Africa during the 1950s. He was the bandleader and lead composer for
                Mbeki's Swing; an Afro-Jazz and Gospel band.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was the only child of Annie and Simon Mbeki. For most of his childhood, he
                lived in a single-parent home with his mother Annie. Due, unfortunately
                to lung cancer, his father passed away when Johnathan was only 5 years old.
                Johnathan was commonly referred to by his peers and members of the community
                as "Papa Johnny" because of his mature and wise outlook on life especially
                in his younger days.
