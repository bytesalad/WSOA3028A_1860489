            <h2>
                Definitions of Hypermedia and How They May Manifest in the Modern Digital Age. 
            </h2>
            <p>
                While reading <cite><a href="http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CS835/Lec3/p126-wardrip-fruin.pdf">"What Hypertext Is?"</a></cite>, 
                a research paper by Noah Wardrip-Fruin, I
                decided to try and discover new perspectives of looking at the different
                definitions of hypermedia. Specifically with regard to the digital media age of
                today. I feel that regarding the context of all the new technologies available
                today, many of the seemingly conflicting definitions of hypermedia and hypertext
                are manifesting together to describe a single object, technology or interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                The definition for <cite><a href="https://books.google.co.za/books/about/
                    Narrative_as_Virtual_Reality.html?id=cjAWAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y">hypertext</a></cite> 
                was stated by Marie-Laure Ryan as follows: “In
                hypertext... the reader determines the unfolding of the text by
                clicking on certain areas, the so-called hyperlinks, that bring to
                the screen other segments of text.” This definition clearly corresponds quite
                directly to the Hypertext Transfer Protocall that is the backbone of the 
                World Wide Web. When browsing the Web (as the term in conveniently shortend to),
                one must click on text or images that link to different bodies of text in a Web
                of nodes. Each website is a node in this web.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's look at the definition of <cite><a href="http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CS835/Lec3/nelson.pdf">hyperfilm</a></cite> proposed by 
                Theodor Holm Nelson who originally
                coined the term. He wrote about "... a browsable or vari-sequenced movie." This definition
                may actually apply to the medium of digital storytelling or story based game design.
                In the case of story based game design, this definition applies in multiple ways.
                Story games can be thought of as a vari-sequenced movie in the sense that they 
                may have some sort of branching narrative structure like a tree of choices. The route
                the player decides to take is like one pespective of a changable story. Different
                players may take different routes. This view allows a story game to be browsable.
                The outcomes of choices may be documented on website forums or books and be
                spoken about.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the light of recent technological development, the definitions of hypermedia
                and hypertext can be thought of as different perspectives of digital media.
                The definitions that speak about text and links describe quite closely the
                experience of using the web. Other definitions of hypermedia such as the
                one for hyperfilm can now be used to describe new technologies that perhaps
                Nelson himself did not even imagine.
