            <p>
                The dot-com bubble refers to a period between the late 1990s and early 2000s
                during which there was a rapid rise and fall of internet commerce websites. It
                had consequences for many years on the global economy. There existed a strong belief that if people 
                invested more money into new tech
                companies sprouting out on the internet, they would grow into massive 
                enterprises with favourable returns. It would not be untrue to say that there
                was indeed growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a few reasons why it could not last:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Tech companies began spent exorbitant amounts of money on marketing. An
                    example of this is Priceline.com's $ 20 million advertising budget.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While making a lot of money, tech companies were also losing a lot of money.
                    Selling their products at a loss was a tactic for increasing their company's
                    market share.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Many of the business ideas of tech companies were unprofitable.
                    Venture capitalists knew this but it did not bother them if the businesses were
                    profitable or not, what mattered was the <cite><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp">IPOs</a></cite>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Professional venture capitalists knew that the dot-com bubble would pop but
                they still invested money because they could make a large amount of money
                and pull out their investment before the dot-com bubble would inevitably
                pop.
