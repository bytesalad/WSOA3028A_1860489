                Johnathan Mbeki was a Jazz bassist/composer living in Sophiatown, Johannesburg,
                South Africa during the 1950s. He was the bandleader and lead composer for
                Mbeki's Swing; an Afro-Jazz and Gospel band.

            <p>
                He was the only child of Annie and Simon Mbeki. For most of his childhood, he
                lived in a single-parent home with his mother Annie. Due, unfortunately
                to lung cancer, his father passed away when Johnathan was only 5 years old.
                Johnathan was commonly referred to by his peers and members of the community
                as "Papa Johnny" because of his mature and wise outlook on life especially
                in his younger days.

                Johnathan's interest in music began when he took his first organ lesson from
                the organ player for the neighbourhood church (where Johnathan
                would also play in later childhood years). Here Johnathan discovered life-long
                love for music and especially for Gospel and Jazz music.

                At the time of writing these blog posts, Johnathan was 31 years old and living in
                Sophiatown trying to make a name for himself. He played in blues/jazz clubs in 
                Sophiatown and surrounding parts of Johannesburg.
