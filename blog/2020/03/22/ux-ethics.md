Heading: Ethical and Technical Considerations of UX/UI Design Principles to Create Inclusive Websites.
Published Date: 22/03/2020

A mouse and keyboard; a monitor and pair of speakers, or a touch-screen interface have become so generally used as methods of interfacing with a computer.
Common webpage layouts that read left-to-right, top-to-bottom and contain modules of content arranged like a catalog are standard practice in web design. 
These practices may be synonymous with digital media design and are implemented without second-thought. Are these methods as effective and inclusive as we
accept them to be? The short answer is no they are not. They may act as barriers to access technology and information for people not familiar with the western 
system, who are physically impaired or who do not have prior experience with using technology. In this blog post, I will explore the standard UX of technology 
and hypermedia and I will also provide an alternative, more inclusive solutions to them based on already existing research and my ideas.

Visual Impaired Persons:

In a paper written by Luis Francisco-Revilla and Jeff Crow [1], the design of modular and multiple-column layout web pages are critiqued as not being
accessible to visually impaired people. This is due to the layout complexity that makes it difficult for screen readers to be able to interpret the content on
the web page. As the complexity of a web page increases, it is found that it takes longer to interpret the web page.

A possible solution to this problem as proposed in the paper is a system that can discover elements used as reference points on a website, interpret what the 
layout of the website is and use that information to help the user understand what is currently on the web page. The system proposed in this paper is called 
WARP V.I.P and acts as an intermediary between the web page and the screen-reader or user.

Other Cultures:

I believe that one of the assumptions that engineers and content developers need to reconsider is the one that the western ideas of the layout of media are
accessible to everyone. Many societies around the world are used to writing and reading the information in ways that are different from the west. For example,
in the traditional Chinese way of writing, text can be arranged to progress from top to bottom in a cell-like manner. It is through the involvement of the west
that societies have adapted to a different method of structuring writing. It may not always be in their best interest and may not always be the most efficient 
and understandable way of doing things. It may also involve having to teach certain societies to rearrange the way they historically write and read.

A solution I propose is a layout management plugin that can be integrated with a browser to reinterpret the layout of text on a page. It may take in an HTML
class argument for tags that may be required to be rendered differently. This solution may cause 
structural problems with the style elements of the page though but it may be sufficient for pages rendered in simple HTML.

Experience of using the technology:

The mouse and keyboard is the de facto input technology for computer systems and it has been this way for many years. Many people who use computers in their 
daily lives do so with the mouse and keyboard as a matter of intuition. It can be hard to imagine a computer without imagining a mouse and keyboard. Yet, for
a person new to using this technology, it can be quite difficult to master the input and even more so for those with disabilities. Already the invention of
the touchscreen interface has made this easier. But we can consider other kinds of technologies that allow us to include other members of the population too.

In his paper "Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology", Steve Gibson [2] discusses human-computer interface technologies and implementations that might
make using a computer system more accessible and more intuitive (more like navigating and interacting with physical spaces). He describes what he calls a 
"hands-free" tracking system that can use ultrasound to detect how a person moves around within a limited physical space connected to a computer system
. This idea is very close to the Virtual Reality interface device of today. Perhaps interface techniques for the Web that make appropriate use of VR
technology is worth considering more deeply for the future.

Conclusion:

As explored in this blog, I believe that there is much work to be done exploring alternative ways of representing information and interacting with information
in computer systems, especially related to Web technology. The current implementations can be seen as ineffective for users of cultures other than the west,
physically impaired people, and those who have not used digital technology before. Possible solutions outlined are systems that make a better attempt at 
interpreting modular webpages for users with screen readers, browsers that can re-arrange web content for cultures who are used to reading text in different
ways and computer interfacing technology that more closely relates to interacting and navigating physical spaces.
