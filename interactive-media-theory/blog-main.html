            <h2>
                Reflection on a Study of Information Geographies
            </h2>
            <p>
                The idea of "Information Geographies" may sound foreign to you but it is used by people all the time. You may not realise how much you make use of it or even need it for daily activities.
                Information Geography is information that exists about geographical locations. It is also information that is created at a specific geographical location. In the paper, the example of the 
                Sydney Opera House is used to illustrate this idea. One cannot just consider the building made of "bricks and mortar" by itself when describing it. Nor just the information about it. It is 
                the place and the experiences and information about it that can be considered the whole entity. This information can be found in guide book entries, website articles, and google maps data 
                [3]. Before one decides to visit the Sydney Opera House, or even consider it as a place worthy to visit, one can be motivated by consuming knowledge about the place. To quote directly from
                the text, "A restaurant omitted from a map can cease to be a restaurant if nobody finds it." In current times as of writing, this is an important detail. Places are undoubtedly augmented
                with digital and written information, of which the digital is increasing in importance. This paper explores why and the implications related to it.

            <h2>
                Ethical and Technical Considerations of UX/UI Design Principles to Create Inclusive Websites
            </h2>
            <p>
                A mouse and keyboard; a monitor and pair of speakers, or a touch-screen interface have become so generally used as methods of interfacing with a computer.
                Common webpage layouts that read left-to-right, top-to-bottom and contain modules of content arranged like a catalog are standard practice in web design. 
                These practices may be synonymous with digital media design and are implemented without second-thought. Are these methods as effective and inclusive as we
                accept them to be? The short answer is no they are not. They may act as barriers to access technology and information for people not familiar with the western 
                system, who are physically impaired or who do not have prior experience with using technology. In this blog post, I will explore the standard UX of technology 
                and hypermedia and I will also provide an alternative, more inclusive solutions to them based on already existing research and my ideas.

                Teaching and Learning Solutions for the COVID-19 Crisis
            </h2>
            <p>
                In this blog post, methods and techniques for taking teaching and learning outside of the university during the <cite><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html">COVID-19</a></cite> crisis will be considered and the
                advantages and disadvantages of them. The various challenges and constraints of these potential solutions are also discussed within the South African context and specifically with reference 
                to <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/">The University of the Witwatersrand</a>. These
                ideas may also be adapted to other countries and other institutions.

                How Effective are the Current Generally Accepted Metaphors for Describing Digital Information Related to the WWW?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Words such as "folder", "path", "link", "location", "home", "document", and "file" have become so popularly compared to computer data structures that
                they can be thought of to the average user as the same. They have provided a level of abstraction for users to better understand how a computer works
                and definitely to better understand how the World Wide Web (WWW) functions. Especially how one can find information and remember where it is. However, are 
                these metaphors effective for all people using the system?

            <h2>
                The Misunderstood Complexity Regarding the Importance of Accessibility on the Web.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Accessibility is a term that is commonly used in web development circles but it can be said that the true 
                extensiveness of its applications and implications are seldomly explored. Accessibility is explored in
                the context of <cite><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Accessibility">disability accessibility</a></cite> and there 
                exists mainly information about accessibility
                regarding this context. It is very important to consider disabled person experiences when using your
                website because if not, one effectively implies a solid barrier of prevention to
                the valuable content on one's website. This is both practical and in some ways ethically a
                negligent implementation of a website. There is more to accessibility than the above consideration
                though. In this blog I will briefly consider each with citations to further reading about the subject.

                Definitions of Hypermedia and How They May Manifest in the Modern Digital Age.
            </h2>
            <p>
                While reading <cite><a href="http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CS835/Lec3/p126-wardrip-fruin.pdf">"What Hypertext Is?"</a></cite>, 
                a research paper by Noah Wardrip-Fruin, I
                decided to try and discover new perspectives of looking at the different
                definitions of hypermedia. Specifically with regard to the digital media age of
                today. I feel that regarding the context of all the new technologies available
                today, many of the seemingly conflicting definitions of hypermedia and hypertext
                are manifesting together to describe a single object, technology or interaction.

            <p>
                The dot-com bubble refers to a period between the late 1990s and early 2000s
                during which there was a rapid rise and fall of internet commerce websites. It
                had consequences for many years on the global economy. There existed a strong belief that if people 
                invested more money into new tech
                companies sprouting out on the internet, they would grow into massive 
                enterprises with favourable returns. It would not be untrue to say that there
                was indeed growth.
