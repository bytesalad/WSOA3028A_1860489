Ways of Teaching and Learning Online:

Introduction:
In this blog post, methods and techniques for taking teaching and learning outside of the university during the COVID-19 crisis will be considered and the
advantages and disadvantages of them. The various challenges and constraints of these potential solutions are also discussed within the South African context and specifically with reference to The University of the Witwatersrand. These ideas may also be adapted to other countries and other institutions.

There will be difficulty adapting the regular University program to the challenges of COVID-19. The university is functionally dependent on face-to-face
interaction, day lectures, access to information through convenient library and laboratory infrastructure, residences to live in, access to lecturer
consultation times and face-to-face feedback and campus-wide internet access. One can say that these aspects of the university building are all necessary
for having a smooth learning experience, although each one of them is under threat from an outbreak of the COVID-19. Face-to-face interaction may not be
permissible as the disease may spread, and all campus-wide physical infrastructure may be made inaccessible as such. Students may also be limited in terms of
their internet access where they stay outside the university. These factors mean that the university and its course system will need to be changed
fundamentally during the period of crisis.

Students will have to be required to work on course material remotely. This is because human interaction will be minimal during this time. Therefore course
materials and classes will need to be adjusted to a different medium. A medium of transmission and access that requires minimal traveling and interaction
with human beings physically. An immediately assignable technology for this task is the internet. It exactly meets the criteria for a medium of transmission
and access. Lectures can be recorded and made available online. Students may be required to be online at the same time as each other to watch the lectures.
There will be occasions when a student may not be able to do this. Therefore lecture materials may need to be stored online to be retrieved at any time. All
of this can be implemented using the Sakai student portal. The greatest disadvantage, though, of this system is allowing equal access to internet services
for students living in different circumstances around the country. This difficulty is compounded by the constraints of operating under load shedding
schedules.

A solution to this problem may involve requiring Telkom services to whitelist the Sakai student portal from internet usage charges so that any student can
use the website freely. This will mitigate internet access costs. It will also allow lectures and documents to be stored for students to access at any time.
A potential disadvantage though of this method is that it does not facilitate a live lecture experience. One can't ask questions directly as if sitting in
the lecture and will need to rely on email or Sakai messaging. There is also the consideration of load shedding and some students may not have ready access
to a computer at home.

Another option that involves usage of the internet may be to put lecture material on a service such as WhatsApp. The advantages of this are that students are
comfortable using this service throughout their daily lives and it is more accessible to have a cellphone than a laptop or desktop computer. WhatsApp also
implements economic compression algorithms to reduce the cost of using the service to watch videos or look at images. The disadvantage is that managing
WhatsApp groups with many people in them is difficult. Many users may be immature and send inappropriate messages or worse make other students feel
uncomfortable. It is also highly cumbersome to manage resources on a WhatsApp group. Updating lecture videos and materials may be challenging.

To reduce the data charges of being able to access lecture material online, lectures may be available in the form of mp3 podcasts that are accompanied by
lecture slides in the form of a document. This way students could use podcasts as a means of following the lectures if they cannot afford to watch
video lectures. The disadvantage is that it would be challenging to explain and discuss visual course content on a podcast. Some subjects require that the
student can see "exactly and follow along" with what the lecturer is doing.

Another potential technique for lecturing students remotely could be to set up special broadcast channels on live television. Live television may be
much more accessible than using the internet or even using the WhatsApp service. This solution may be the most expensive and challenging to implement as
it requires the participation of the SABC, may not be able to accommodate every course and cannot allow for material to be stored and accessed at a later
stage if a student misses a lecture.

There are a few options to consider for making course content available over the internet or through other means but there may be no perfect solution. I
propose the problem-solving strategy of implementing as many different redundant services as possible to allow students who may not have access to one, to
have access to another. This, of course, increases the cost of the entire system considerably. The University of the Witwatersrand needs to consider these
options and their implications very carefully when designing contingency plans.
