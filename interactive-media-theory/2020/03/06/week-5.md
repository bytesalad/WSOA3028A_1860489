Title: How Effective are the Current Generally Accepted Metaphors for Describing Digital Information Related to the WWW?

Words such as "folder", "path", "link", "location", "home", "document", and "file" have become so popularly compared to computer data structures that
they can be thought of to the average user as the same. They have provided a level of abstraction for users to better understand how a computer works
and definitely to better understand how the World Wide Web (WWW) functions. Especially how one can find information and remember where it is. However, are 
these metaphors effective for all people using the system?

Abstraction in computation is a means of hiding the unnecessary details of a system. This allows the user of a said particular system to be able to use it and
not have to understand the full details of its implementation. A consequence of this design principle is that abstract objects can be compared with familiar 
ones in terms of functionality. This is very convenient.

Metaphors such as "path", "home page", "file" and "links" all provide a means for navigation. Navigating the WWW is made to be as intuitive as navigating the
real world as possible. How we get around is through roads as linkages. Each person has a home. Files are collected like libraries that can be navigated on 
one's computer. These all consider the spatial orientation (cite) of the user. The user knows what information is available, where to get it and where they
have already been in the network (cite).

The purpose of these metaphors for describing digital information is to be relatable and familiar to the user. That way the user engages with the computer
system intuitively. If these metaphors are not recognisable or familiar for the user though, then their usefulness breaks down. People from societies not
familiar with "folders", "documents" and "files" may not understand their significance. Furthermore, they may make it more difficult to understand the
computer system because one would first have to understand the metaphor and then how it relates to the computer system.

Therefore it is necessary as a developer and a designer to consider the metaphors one uses to represent and explain computer systems to users. Especially
on the WWW, which is increasingly being adopted by cultures all around the world, one needs to be aware of the limitations and assumptions of current generally accepted metaphors for digital information.
