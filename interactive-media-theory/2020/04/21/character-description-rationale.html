            <h4>
                Here I break down the reason's why I chose to do this character and an overview of how I plan to develop the character
                on this website.
            </h4>
            <p>
                Johnathan Mbeki is a musically minded character which, in ways, reminds me of myself. It can be easier to write about
                experiences similar to your own than a distant character. When I initially thought of Sophiatown, the first idea
                that came into mind is the vibrant music culture before the 
                <cite><a href="https://www.hoddereducation.co.uk/media/Documents/Magazines/Sample%20Articles/November%202017/ModHisRev20_2_Nov2017_sample.pdf">forced relocations</a></cite> 
                of South Africa during the apartheid era. Therefore it was fitting to set the
                events of his blogs during the 1950s. It gives me room to play around with his and other members of the
                community's perceptions of music and the events of the forced relocations that happen at the same time. The blogs
                are a means of Johnathan Mbeki writing journal articles.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to contrast the life he leads playing music with the mundane reality of working the fields and having to bring
                in money to survive. His greatest goal is to compose well-known music that can impact people's lives for the better.
                What effect will the relocations have on his goals, relationships, and outlook on life?
            </p>
            <p>
                On a more technical note, because he composes music I can make use of the audio tag in html to provide more immersion
                for his stories. He would love it if the world can hear his music and the internet is the perfect place to
                put it out there. As Johnathan improves the music he composes, one will hear better versions of the same blues piece.
                I am using a digital audio workstation along with my piano and some instrument samples to compose the music. This
                also helps me to engage with my character more because as I develop the music, I can think of ideas to take the story
                forward. It also helps me to imagine the different members of his band and what they might do.
