Title: Reflection on a Study of Information Geographies:
Subtitle: Towards a study of information geographies:
(im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the
geographies of information

Before I can get onto tackling the ideas and implications of this paper, I need to lay some groundwork. What is geography exactly? According to National Geographic, [2]
"Geography is the study of places and the relationships between people and their environments." I want to draw particular attention to "the relationships between people and their
environments." This will be useful later on in this post. In their paper [1], Graham et al. refers to a common definition of information as "the imparting of knowledge" (Oxford English Dictionary 2015). With these two definitions at the back of your mind, let's get to the details of "Information Geographies."

The idea of "Information Geographies" may sound foreign to you but it is used by people all the time. You may not realise how much you make use of it or even need it for daily activities.
Information Geography is information that exists about geographical locations. It is also information that is created at a specific geographical location. In the paper, the example of the 
Sydney Opera House is used to illustrate this idea. One cannot just consider the building made of "bricks and mortar" by itself when describing it. Nor just the information about it. It is 
the place and the experiences and information about it that can be considered the whole entity. This information can be found in guide book entries, website articles, and google maps data 
[3]. Before one decides to visit the Sydney Opera House, or even consider it as a place worthy to visit, one can be motivated by consuming knowledge about the place. To quote directly from
the text, "A restaurant omitted from a map can cease to be a restaurant if nobody finds it." In current times as of writing, this is an important detail. Places are undoubtedly augmented
with digital and written information, of which the digital is increasing in importance. This paper explores why and the implications related to it.

In the early days of the information age, an optimistic outlook was popular about its implications. A passage reads, "digitally mediated participation
and representation is broad based, circumventing traditional mediators of information, and allowing citizens to play a more significant role in shaping the content and augmentations that 
play key roles in their lives." Some academics envisioned a liberating experience when creating and consuming information in the digital age. It did not quite turn out like that.

Graham et al.[1] outlines several categories of geographies of information. This is done to look at access, creation, and representations of information around the world and whether it is 
indeed fair play or not. These categories are:

* Geographies of access and enablement.
* Geographies of participation.
* Geographies of representation.

Section: Geographies of access and enablement.
Here the number of internet users is compared between countries. The price as a percentage of the average person's average income is also shown in a separate image.

[number of internet users - image]
It can be seen that there is a large difference between the number of internet users in different countries. The world map is significantly distorted and it can be seen that certain
countries, especially in the northern hemisphere have a far greater amount of internet users as compared to other countries.
[broadband per income - image]
The irony of the image above is that countries who contribute a comparatively greater amount of internet users, have the cheapest broadband compared to the average person's income.
Countries least active on the internet have correspondingly exorbitantly expensive internet compared to their average income. 

This data is used by Graham et al. to show that certain groups of people are not given adequate opportunity to represent themselves through information. What may not have been explored 
enough in the paper is how alternate methods of preserving, creating, and maintaining information could be more prominently used in countries. They could be writing their narratives
in a way that is not the western standard. For users accessing information through the internet though, there is still the issue of certain countries writing large chunks of
information about others (and potentially affecting the way they are represented negatively).

Section: Geographies of participation.
Three variables are compared country by country in this section namely: domain names, GitHub users, and Wikipedia edits. These items are chosen because they are "communities of practice that transcend the particularise of any one place" according to Graham et al [1].

[Distribution of Domain Names - Image]
In the above image, a correlation to previous data can be seen. Comparatively higher amounts of domain names are registered in the northern hemisphere to specific countries than in the southern hemisphere. It can also be seen that even though some populations are quite large, they may not have a correspondingly large amount of domains registered. Domain names may be 
a method of tracking ownership of information but we may need to bear in mind that certain domains allow users from multiple countries to publish information such as social media and
content creation sites.
