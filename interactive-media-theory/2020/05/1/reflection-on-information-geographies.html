                Reflection on a Study of Information Geographies:
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Towards a study of information geographies:
                (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the
                geographies of information
            </h3>
            <p>
                Before I can get onto tackling the ideas and implications of this paper, I need to lay some groundwork. What is geography exactly? According to National Geographic, [2]
                "Geography is the study of places and the relationships between people and their environments." I want to draw particular attention to "the relationships between people and their
                environments." This will be useful later on in this post. In their paper [1], Graham et al. refers to a common definition of information as "the imparting of knowledge" (Oxford English 
                Dictionary 2015). With these two definitions at the back of your mind, let's get to the details of "Information Geographies."
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of "Information Geographies" may sound foreign to you but it is used by people all the time. You may not realise how much you make use of it or even need it for daily activities.
                Information Geography is information that exists about geographical locations. It is also information that is created at a specific geographical location. In the paper, the example of the 
                Sydney Opera House is used to illustrate this idea. One cannot just consider the building made of "bricks and mortar" by itself when describing it. Nor just the information about it. It is 
                the place and the experiences and information about it that can be considered the whole entity. This information can be found in guide book entries, website articles, and google maps data 
                [3]. Before one decides to visit the Sydney Opera House, or even consider it as a place worthy to visit, one can be motivated by consuming knowledge about the place. To quote directly from
                the text, "A restaurant omitted from a map can cease to be a restaurant if nobody finds it." In current times as of writing, this is an important detail. Places are undoubtedly augmented
                with digital and written information, of which the digital is increasing in importance. This paper explores why and the implications related to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the early days of the information age, an optimistic outlook was popular about its implications. A passage reads, "digitally mediated participation
                and representation is broad based, circumventing traditional mediators of information, and allowing citizens to play a more significant role in shaping the content and augmentations that 
                play key roles in their lives." Some academics envisioned a liberating experience when creating and consuming information in the digital age. It did not quite turn out like that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Graham et al.[1] outlines several categories of geographies of information. This is done to look at access, creation, and representations of information around the world and whether it is 
                indeed fair play or not. These categories are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Geographies of access and enablement.</li>
                <li>Geographies of participation.</li>
                <li>Geographies of representation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Geographies of access and enablement.
            </h3>

            </figure>
            <p>
                It can be seen that there is a large difference between the number of internet users in different countries. The world map is significantly distorted and it can be seen that certain
                countries, especially in the northern hemisphere have a far greater amount of internet users as compared to other countries.
            </p>

                alt="Cost of broadband as a percentage of average income."

            </figure>
            <p>
                The irony of the image above is that countries who contribute a comparatively greater amount of internet users, have the cheapest broadband compared to the average person's income.
                Countries least active on the internet have correspondingly exorbitantly expensive internet compared to their average income.
            </p>
            <p>
                This data is used by Graham et al. to show that certain groups of people are not given adequate opportunity to represent themselves through information. What may not have been explored 
                enough in the paper is how alternate methods of preserving, creating, and maintaining information could be more prominently used in countries. They could be writing their narratives
                in a way that is not the western standard. For users accessing information through the internet though, there is still the issue of certain countries writing large chunks of
                information about others (and potentially affecting the way they are represented negatively).

                Geographies of participation.

            <p>
                Three variables are compared country by country in this section namely: domain names, GitHub users, and Wikipedia edits. These items are chosen because they are "communities of practice 
                that transcend the particularise of any one place" according to Graham et al [1].
