            <p>
                Before I can get onto tackling the ideas and implications of this paper, I need to lay some groundwork. What is geography exactly? According to National Geographic, [1]
                "Geography is the study of places and the relationships between people and their environments." I want to draw particular attention to "the relationships between people and their
                environments." This will be useful later on in this post. In their paper [2], Graham et al. refers to a common definition of information as "the imparting of knowledge" (Oxford English 
                Dictionary 2015). With these two definitions at the back of your mind, let's get to the details of "Information Geographies."
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of "Information Geographies" may sound foreign to you but it is used by people all the time. You may not realise how much you make use of it or even need it for daily activities.
                Information Geography is information that exists about geographical locations. It is also information that is created at a specific geographical location. In the paper, the example of the 
                Sydney Opera House is used to illustrate this idea. One cannot just consider the building made of "bricks and mortar" by itself when describing it. Nor just the information about it. It is 
                the place and the experiences and information about it that can be considered the whole entity. This information can be found in guide book entries, website articles, and google maps data 
                [3]. Before one decides to visit the Sydney Opera House, or even consider it as a place worthy to visit, one can be motivated by consuming knowledge about the place. To quote directly from
                the text, "A restaurant omitted from a map can cease to be a restaurant if nobody finds it." In current times as of writing, this is an important detail. Places are undoubtedly augmented
                with digital and written information, of which the digital is increasing in importance. This paper explores why and the implications related to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the early days of the information age, an optimistic outlook was popular about its implications. A passage reads, "digitally mediated participation
                and representation is broad based, circumventing traditional mediators of information, and allowing citizens to play a more significant role in shaping the content and augmentations that 
                play key roles in their lives." Some academics envisioned a liberating experience when creating and consuming information in the digital age. It did not quite turn out like that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Graham et al.[1] outlines several categories of geographies of information. This is done to look at access, creation, and representations of information around the world and whether it is 
                indeed fair play or not. These categories are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Geographies of access and enablement.</li>
                <li>Geographies of participation.</li>
                <li>Geographies of representation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Geographies of access and enablement.

                height="600"

            </figure>
            <p>
                It can be seen that there is a large difference between the number of internet users in different countries. The world map is significantly distorted and it can be seen that certain
                countries, especially in the northern hemisphere have a far greater amount of internet users as compared to other countries.
            </p>

                <img src="cost-of-broadband.png" 
                alt="Cost of broadband as a percentage of average income."

            </figure>
            <p>
                The irony of the image above is that countries who contribute a comparatively greater amount of internet users, have the cheapest broadband compared to the average person's income.
                Countries least active on the internet have correspondingly exorbitantly expensive internet compared to their average income.
            </p>
            <p>
                This data is used by Graham et al. to show that certain groups of people are not given adequate opportunity to represent themselves through information. What may not have been explored 
                enough in the paper is how alternate methods of preserving, creating, and maintaining information could be more prominently used in countries. They could be writing their narratives
                in a way that is not the western standard. For users accessing information through the internet though, there is still the issue of certain countries writing large chunks of
                information about others (and potentially affecting the way they are represented negatively).
            </p>
            <h3>
                Geographies of participation.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Three variables are compared country by country in this section namely: domain names, GitHub users, and Wikipedia edits. These items are chosen because they are "communities of practice 
                that transcend the particularise of any one place" according to Graham et al [1].
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="distribution-domain-names.png" 
                alt="Distribution of Domain Names by Country."

            </figure>
            <p>
                In the above image, a correlation to previous data can be seen. Comparatively higher amounts of domain names are registered in the northern hemisphere to specific countries than in the 
                southern hemisphere. It can also be seen that even though some populations are quite large, they may not have a correspondingly large amount of domains registered. Domain names may be 
                a method of tracking ownership of information but we may need to bear in mind that certain domains allow users from multiple countries to publish information such as social media and
                content creation sites.

            <p>
                Since GitHub is the "largest code hosting service in the world" [1], its usage may prove to be a useful way to look at geographies of participation. To add to that, a code hosting service
                like this is useful to consider because this paper is aimed primarily at digital information geographies. Software drives the way one interacts with the internet and the parameters
                of how it can be used. How one designs the software that drives the internet and its information networks also affects how different societies represent themselves and their
                locations on the internet (and whether they even can at all!).
            </p>
            <p>
                If one considers the image above, the number of GitHub users or commits per country is shown. We can see once again that the data is favourable to developed countries and the northern
                hemisphere. The differences between countries are also stark with the USA overwhelming everyone else by far. Most of the software written can be said to originate in specific countries.
                This software drives the information age.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, for some countries, alternative ways of managing and storing code might be more realistic than GitHub because of broadband restrictions. So we need to bear in mind that once 
                again, the data in this paper is not the be-it and end-all of this analysis.

            <p>
                Wikipedia is a massive encyclopedia of information that can be contributed to by anyone with internet access. It is also the most used encyclopedia in the world by far [1]. In their paper,
                Graham et al. points out that it supports 282 languages (40 of those with more than 10 000 articles). "In other words, edits to Wikipedia have tremendous power to shape content accessed 
                by the majority of internet users around the world."[1] In theory, everyone and anyone from any country should be able to put up edits to Wikipedia and we should see an even spread of
                participation. This is not the case.
            </p>
            <p>
                The above image illustrates an unequal landscape. It shows how the majority of Wikipedia edits over 3 months originate from a select few countries in the north. 
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="edits-english-wikipedia.png" 
                alt="Percentage of Edits to English-language Wikipedia Articles from Local People."

            </figure>
            <p>
                This image describes the percentage of Wikipedia edits made by local people about their places. To me, this data is truly shocking. This is because, especially in Africa and the global
                South, very little of a country's own information is written by its people on Wikipedia. Who is writing their narratives for them?
            </p>
            <p>
                Once again, Wikipedia is but one way of writing information on the internet and some countries may prefer other methods that are more comfortable to them. Also, the data in the above image
                is based only on edits to English language Wikipedia pages. This may be problematic because there are many countries where English is not spoken as much and is not the preferred language
                to document information.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Geographies of representation.
            </h3>
            <p>
                In this section, Graham et al. make use of Google Search, OpenStreetMap, Freebase, and Geonames data to look at "contours of representation" of information augmentations about geography
                around the world. In simple terms, how is geographical information of the planet represented using information geographies? (Read that sentence a few times over if you need to).
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="google-search-results-country-name.png" 
                alt="Percentage of Edits to English-language Wikipedia Articles from Local People."

            </figure>
            <p>
                If we look at the above image from Graham et al. [1], we can see that Google search results per country name indicates the inequalities of access and participation that have been mentioned
                before.
            </p>

            <p>
                OpenStreetMap is a roadmap that is free and open-source and is used as a starting point for many other services commonly used around the world. Although one can see that there are
                areas that are darker (more densely mapped) than others, it is quite smooth on average. Certain areas have very little data for obvious reasons (such as desert areas
                and places where few people live and are required to move around in). Certain densely mapped areas such as "California alone accounts for as much content as the whole continent of Africa."
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="georeferenced-objects-freebase.png" 
                alt="Number of georeferenced objects in Freebase."
                height="600"
                width="1200"

            </figure>
            <p>
                Freebase is a "general-purpose knowledge base" that contains many entities and Geonames is "the world’s largest and probably most-used gazetteer or directory of place names." We can see
                that Freebase data is densely concentrated in just a select few countries (such as the USA and in European countries) and hardly anywhere else in the world. It is calculated in the paper
                that there are very few placenames per thousand inhabitants in countries such as India as compared to the US (one for every 1500 people). This is problematic because Freebase data is
                used by Google to help people find important places such as shops and monuments around them.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="placenames-geonames.png" 
                alt="Distribution of placenames in geonames."
                height="600"

                <figcaption>Credit: [1].</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                If one looks at the Geonames data collected by Graham et al., one can see a slightly better-looking spread of information but the density still reflects what is discussed about Freebase.
                USA still accounts for "25% of the entire database."
            </p>
            <p>
                This data is important to consider because, as explained in the paper, Freebase and Geonames are used for many different information services on the internet such as encoding social media
                posts with geographical metadata and annotating shops and restaurants. This unequal landscape could have lasting problematic effects on information geography and representation of 
                people across the world. Many areas such as North America and Europe have dense representation on different widely used platforms yet other countries hardly.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p>
                To end their paper, Graham et al. reinforces the idea that the current technology for representing information online is not too different to traditional information technologies
                in terms of how equally different people's information is represented (such as book publishing and academic journal production). Their research provides a starting point for further
                research into the likely causes for such data, how it can be related to the impacts of post-colonial modes of governance and deeper dives into data about information geographies.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is stressed further that we need to focus on the questions of what and where is represented and who can participate in this process. "In order for Google, Wikipedia,
                OSM and many other types of geographic information to be able to augment cities, geographic content needs to be unfixed from its containers (e.g. books or universities) 
                and then simultaneously fixed or tethered to specific locations, accessible to those in situ armed with the right technological affordances."
            </p>

                On that note, I end this blog and thank you for reading.
