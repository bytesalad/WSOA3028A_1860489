Heading: What is the SoundCloud Embedded Player [1] and How does it work?

In simple terms, the SoundCloud embedded player [1] is a simplified version of the soundcloud.com website that can be displayed as "embedded" into your 
webpage. Embedded elements can allow HTML documents to be displayed inside another. One can think of it almost like a browser inside your HTML document. In my 
case, some content from the soundcloud.com website is being displayed on this site where needed.

Heading: Why did I use it?

Part of this website serves as a journal to some of the events in a fictional character's life. His name is Johnathan Mbeki and he is a musician, composer, and
bandleader. His music serves as a way of allowing the reader to feel more immersed in his life. That is why I chose to explore how I can use web technology 
to reinforce the level of immersion the reader has with the site.

The SoundCloud player provides a direct link to Johnathan Mbeki's music from this website. People reading these blog posts will be able to follow him and get
his latest music there too. In addition to that experience, hosting his music on SoundCloud makes his presence feel more "real" than if his music was just
available here on my website. SoundCloud also allows me to link Johnathan's life and experiences to the worldwide community of musicians on the internet. 
Because of that, this website isn't the only way to find out and interact with Johnathan Mbeki. His music can appear on a user's recommendations and playlists 
outside of this website. This makes Johnathan a part of the Johannesburg internet music scene in South Africa. 

By liking and following his music on SoundCloud, you are actively engaging and interacting with him. This makes Johnathan Mbeki feel less like a static 
fictional character and more like a dynamic, living artist in Johannesburg.

Heading: Technical Impact and Alternatives.

Alternatives to using the SoundCloud player can be to use Howler.js [2] or the HTML5 Audio functionality. Howler.js is a JavaScript library that provides more 
features to any audio playback on your website like stereo panning and audio crossfading and looping. While these are impressive features to have, they 
will take longer to implement than the SoundCloud player. They also mean that the only place one will be able to play Johnathan Mbeki's music is on my 
website. One of my goals was to extend the content of this website beyond its confines and closer to other musicians in Johannesburg. Howler.js would not 
suffice for that. The basic HTML5 audio functionality can also be used but just like Howler.js, it limits Johnathan's music to the confines of my website 
which is not the intention.
