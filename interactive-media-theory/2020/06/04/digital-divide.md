What is the digital divide and how does it affect South Africans.

Upon researching the concept of the "digital divide", I came across a paper written by Christian Fuchs and Eva Horak about the implications of the digital
divide in Africa. It is called "Africa and the digital divide" and I put a link to this paper in the references list below the blog post [1].

It is quite an eye-opening research paper and has been cited by other researchers many times. In this blog post, I will only be able to go through the main 
points and leave the rest to the reader's curiosity. Now, let us dive in and deconstruct the idea.

Before reading this blog post, I would highly recommend checking out my post on information geographies [cite] because this one can be thought of as a direct
continuation of the ideas mentioned there.

Heading: What is the digital divide?

The paper starts by providing some definitions for the idea of the "digital divide". These definitions are then used to reinforce the idea of a list of 
"types" of digital divides.

The general idea in the above image is that of "inequality of access to the internet" and "distribution" of this access. People cannot make use of the 
internet and its vast troves of information if they do not have access to a computer or a network connection.

There can be thought of as four barriers of access to the internet:

This is interesting because it shows that the digital divide can occur because of several different things. Those who are not exposed to digital media or 
devices may not be able to use them when the opportunity arises or know how they can be of benefit. This is "mental access". "Skill access" refers to 
having the skills to be able to use digital devices and understand how they can be productive. "Usage access" is about the opportunities provided to people
to make use of the technology in a meaningful way.

Okay... this is interesting but still pretty abstract and what does it have to do with us as South Africans?

Heading: How does it affect us?

Well, the authors go to great length to explain that "... technologies enable and constrain human practices...". Which means that the level of technology one 
has access to, produces classes of "winners and losers of the information society". If one cannot interact with the information world, the digital space or the
internet, then one is effectively excluded from a major aspect of the world's industries and institutions. Your story may never be heard and your ideas may 
not be propagated to other societies. Their ideas may not reach you. This leads to marginalisation and power play between the societies of the world. If 
you're more interested in how this phenomenon comes about and what it means, see my post on another influential paper on information geographies [cite].

The digital divide is caused by stratification patterns of social hierarchies and structural inequalities in society. Your "age, family status, ability, gender
, ethnicity, origin language and geography" all play a key role in your ability to access the internet, use it for your benefit and create your own meaningful
content to share with the greater cyberspace.

Heading: Yes... but South Africa?

A country's level of development in terms of income, education, and health is effected by the level of internet access and usage rates. In South Africa, 
the telecommunications sector was handed over to the private sector to implement. This did not have a good effect on bridging the gap between South Africa 
and the global world. Over time, more people can access the internet here in South Africa, but not those in poverty or who do not have
material access to digital technology. There is a definite level of stratification based on income, one's social status, the area one lives in and the ability 
to use digital technology (skill access). These inequalities, as pointed out in the paper, propagate to the globally networked society and affect a South 
African's ability to be an influential global citizen. Are we writing our narratives? And if we aren't, who is? [cite]

Structural inequalities based on material, mental, skill and usage access can be traced back to years of colonial and post-colonial exploitation, global 
exclusion and "dependency on the Third World" as Fuchs and Horak describe it.

Heading: Conclusion

Reading through this paper gave me new insight into the digital divide, what it means and how it is related to the study of information geographies. It also
provides some unique insight into what everything means within the African context. It is quite dense, and if you would like to read it yourself and use it
for your own research, check out the link in my references.

Thank you for your time and keep safe during the pandemic [cite].
