Heading: What is Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision?

In the paper [1], Artificial Intelligence is defined as "a growing resource of interactive, autonomous, self-learning agency, which enables computational
artifacts to perform tasks that otherwise would require human intelligence to be executed successfully". Computer vision is a subset of AI engineering that 
allows computers to be able to "see" events in the real world or perceive distinct details in an image. The leading technology to enable this is called 
Computer Vision Machine Learning (CVML). It is a special application of machine learning. The applications for computer vision can be facial recognition and 
self-driving cars.

Heading: Ethical concerns.

[1] J. Howard. [@jeremyphoward], This is huge. The creator of the YOLO algorithms, which (along with SSD) set much of the path of modern object detection, has 
stopped doing any computer vision research due to ethical concerns. I've never seen anything quite like this before., Twitter,  Feb. 20, 2020. [Online]
