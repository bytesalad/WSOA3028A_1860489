            <h2>
                The Misunderstood Complexity Regarding the Importance of Accessibility on the Web.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Accessibility is a term that is commonly used in web development circles but it can be said that the true 
                extensiveness of its applications and implications are seldomly explored. Accessibility is explored in
                the context of <cite><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Accessibility">disability accessibility</a></cite> and there 
                exists mainly information about accessibility
                regarding this context. It is very important to consider disabled person experiences when using your
                website because if not, one effectively implies a solid barrier of prevention to
                the valuable content on one's website. This is both practical and in some ways ethically a
                negligent implementation of a website. There is more to accessibility than the above consideration
                though. In this blog I will briefly consider each with citations to further reading about the subject.
            </p>
            <p>
                A website that appears on the first page or even as one of the first entries on a page using a search
                engine can mean the difference between a person finding your website 
                <cite><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/333175.333181">useful</a></cite> or not. This is
                because it implies a good quality website and improves the ease of access to the website. The
                idea of making your website accessible through the search engine is called search engine
                optimisation (SEO). <cite><a href="https://www.singlegrain.com/seo/effective-seo-techniques-that-work/">Aspects to consider</a></cite> 
                here are the general user experience of your website,
                a well-considered website URL structure, and applying thoughtful semantic markup elements to allow
                SEO bots to crawl through the content of your website more easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web developers should not neglect the importance of the correct use of 
                <cite><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/01/html5-article-section/">semantic markup</a></cite>. It allows
                accessibility tools such as web readers for blind people to understand the structure of your
                website better. But it doesn't stop there! There are a wide plethora of useful programs called
                <cite><a href="https://opensourceforu.com/2017/07/web-robots-worker-bees-internet/">bots</a></cite> 
                that are crawling the web at every instant. Many bots can extract useful information
                from your website that makes it easier for users to find it. One such example is Googlebots which
                use the information on your website to rank it on google search results. To allow web bots to explore your website as 
                easily as possible, good semantic 
                markup is one of the most important considerations. Others include having useful website
                metadata and URL structures.
            </p>
            <p>
                A website develops society through the information one makes available. What use is a website
                with good, knowledgable information when the average person cannot access it? Therefore it can
                be concluded that accessibility considerations include the experiences of disabled persons but
                also the accessibility of one's website to anyone or anything that uses the world wide web.
